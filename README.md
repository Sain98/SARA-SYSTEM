Discord bot, not much usefull in it just for learning and playing around with it

## To use:
wanna test it locally make a .env file in the root folder
and put this in it:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN={YOUR_TOKEN}
DISCORD_SECRET={YOUR_SECRET}
DISCORD_ID={BOT_ID}
```

It is a bit hardcoded to a private discord server, see `message_list.py`
```
CUCK_CHAT_ID = 445655031207690282
BOT_SPAM_ID = 733739729727651931
QUOTES_CHANNEL_ID = 575000109272662016
```
change the numbers to a channel ID that works for your usage
